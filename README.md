Wordle but with more letters. Made in Odin

This is my first real project using Odin, so the code is VERY messy. I'm just
gonna use the actual strings library next time I think...

I haven't checked it out completely yet, but so far Odin seems to me like an amazing successor to C.
It feels just as comfortable to program in, and comes with so many useful additions. Not as much
as C++ or Rust though, so its pretty easy to pick up.
